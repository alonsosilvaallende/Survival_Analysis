# Survival Analysis: a practical guide

This notebook's purpose is to introduce basic concepts of Survival Analysis.
 - Democracy and Dictatorship: Introduces right censoring and Kaplan-Meier estimator on the Democracy and Dictatorship dataset.
 - Cox PH vs Gradient Boosting Cox PH: Compares these two methods to estimate the risks of patients on the German Breast Cancer Study Group 2 dataset (gbcsg).
I use lifelines and scikit-survival to do these analyses.
